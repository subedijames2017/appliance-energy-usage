 * Calculates the total energy usage (in minutes) for an appliance over a single day (0â€“1439 minutes).

 * The function uses an initial state (`on` or `off`) and an array of timestamped events
 * that switch the appliance between states. It calculates how long the appliance remains
 * in the 'on' state throughout the day.
 *
 * @param {Object} profile - The usage profile for the day.
 * @param {string} profile.initial - Initial state of the appliance ('on' or 'off').
 * @param {Array<Object>} profile.events - Array of state change events with structure: { timestamp: number, state: string }.
 *
 * @returns {number} Total minutes the appliance was ON during the day.
 * @throws {Error} If the profile is invalid or events are malformed.
